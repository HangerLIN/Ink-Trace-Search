## Last But not Least

When Yuque went dark, it was a stark reminder of the fragility inherent in cloud-based systems. Convenience and accessibility are alluring, indeed, but at what cost? The risk of data disappearing as if swallowed by a digital black hole cannot be understated. This incident reaffirmed my commitment to local note management – a bastion for convenience and the sovereignty of data.

Yet, in returning to the terrestrial realm of local storage, I was confronted with a new challenge: my markdown notes were like stars strewn across a vast digital universe, each file a world unto itself. Seeking out information was akin to an endless quest through the cosmos, where sometimes the stars seemed to hide behind nebulae of complexity. I longed not for the Odyssey but for the immediacy of discovery – the thrill of instant knowledge at my fingertips, much like the clarity one finds in the cloud.

I dreamt of a tool – a beacon to pierce the depths of directories, to bring forth files with the ease of a conjurer’s spell. Regardless of how deeply buried within the folds of my computer's files, this tool would trace every key words, every sentences for me.

With such a dream at heart, "InkTrace" came into being. I envisaged it as a digital detective, relentless in its pursuit of clues, capable of unveiling the knowledge I sought with a mere keystroke.

InkTrace was to be my digital familiar, an extension of my mind, adept at unearthing the buried treasures of my creativity. It was designed to sift through layers of data, ensuring that not a single shard of insight was lost to the void.

More than a mere tool, InkTrace is about regaining control over the vast seas of knowledge we navigate daily. It is a pledge to those who cherish their intellectual pursuits, to the seekers of unfailing reliability without surrendering the convenience of modernity. Each line of code, each functional nuance, is crafted with a promise: to make the management of knowledge as fluid as the ink of a poet's pen, as certain and confident as the scholar's quill. 

This is not merely a goal; it is a dedication – my dedication, and the very essence of InkTrace's existence.
